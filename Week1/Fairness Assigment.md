# FAIRNESS IN MACHINNE LEARNING
-------------------------------------
## I AM VERY HAPPY TO LEARN FAIRNESS IN MACHINE LEARNING  FOR TODAY'S TOPIC
**What is Fairness in Machine Learning**
Fairness Machine Learning is the process of removing or correcting bias intentionally or otherwise from models, train data of Machine Learning , bias can be from data or models.
**Example of bias data:** In a situation were there is inadequate data of one parametre, for example if you are making a model between divorced and married people who is happier among them, married people data is always available can be easier to get than divorced people, this can couse bias in the data, can also effect model for prediction.

**Example of Bias Model**
if trained data is manipulated intentionally or not it will definitely effect the Model, this can make the model to be Bias Model.

### WAYS OF MITIGATING UNFAIRNESS
I also learned some ways of mitigating unfairness, though we can't completely removed them , but we can reduce it to very meaningful percentage.
**Learn and Understand your Model then build in Fairness**
Understand your model very well, know the beneficts and affects of it, from there you can build the fairness in the model, explore the model to generate various mitigated models 
**Example of Mitigated Model is Fairlearn**
Fairlearn is an open is an open-source Python package that hepls you mitigate your unfairness and assess your fairness.
