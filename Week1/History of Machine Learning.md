# HISTORY OF MACHINE LEARNING
--------------------------------
## I LEARNED THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT HISTORY ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING.
Machine Learning has gone through diffrent phases from development phases up to where its now, below are some of notable brief history about Machine Learning.
**1943: The First Neutral Network with Electric Circuit** 
It was developed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943. Thier main goal is to make computers communicate with each other, thier early model make it possible for two computers to communicate without any humman interaction. also this solved  some problems posed by John von Neumann and others: 
**1950: Turing Test**
Proposed by mathematician Alan Turing, the main goal of the Alan test is to test weather machine intelligence can immitate human intelligence or weather a Quationer can't diffirentiate between human and machine regardless of the answers, Alan test was heavily criticized by many,on his idea to comapre machine intelligence and that of Human instead of him to concentrate on Machine Intelligence only.
**1952: Computer Checkers**
Machine Learning model was first created by Arthur Samuel with his model to play championship-level checkers, he uses a technique called alpha-beta pruning to measure the chances of winning a game and he also developed an algorithm called minimax algorithm for minimizing match losing in a game.
**1957: Frank Rosenblatt â€“ The Perceptron**
A psychologist called Frank Rosenblatt developed the perceptron algorithm in 1957 which is one of the first algorithms widely used in Machine Learning, the goal of the algorithm is to lean from data and to improve computer predictions accuaracy.
**1956 - 1974: "The golden years**
Years between 1956  to  1974 are called "The golden years" in Machine Learning, becouse is the years where hope in AI is very high, support from government agencies and other institute is very high  and well funded, there is much advancements in complex algorithms,computations many problems were solved using AI
**1974 - 1980: "AI Winter"**
Is the years of difficiulties in AI, is the years where confidence is very low, lack of funding, paucity of data and Limitations in compute powers among others.
**1980s Expert systems**
in the mid 8os
