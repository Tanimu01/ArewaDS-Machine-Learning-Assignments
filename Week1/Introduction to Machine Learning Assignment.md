# Introduction to Machince Learning
-----
## I understand  the following definations and meanings in to day's lesson and thier examples:

1. Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning
3. Artificial Inteligence 
4. Why do we need Machine Learning

**What is Machine Learning:-** Machine learing is one of the most important area in the field of data science, is the process of making machine to learn data just like humain brains and to make decisions without much input of humans or without being explicitly programmed. In this way machince has much freedom to learn, understand data using Mathematical, statistical and algorithms to make a better decisions, Machine learning is a subset of AI.
**Example of Machine Learning is Chartbot:** Chartbot (Online Customer Support), like in Health, Banking and Education, where a customer can live support without the actual intervention of Human.
**What is Deep Learning** Deep Learning is a subset of AI and Machine Learning, i.e to say, AI is the Head, followed by Machine Learning then Deep Learning. Deep Learning can be defined as a subset of Machine Learning that don't require Human intervention to learn from environment, its uses more complex algorithms and large data compare to Deep Learning to learn and make decisions.
**Example of Deep Learning is Speech Recognition:** 
It differentiates between different languages, for example it can easily detect if you are speaking Hausa, English, Arabic and the type of Accents.
**What is artificial intelligence (AI)?** AI is an important  field of Data Science, its a Science and Engineering for making machine Intelligence i.e Human like brain, it may not be as exactly as human brain but it can solve many problems, its also a combination of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
**Example of AI is Self Driving Car:** A Car that drive its self without need of Human help, its loaded with diffrent kind of sensor data with very high accuaracy, that act within blank of an eye, 

**Why do we need Machine Learnig?**
1. Its needed in many indutries, like Finance, Health, Education in order to increase the efficiency of the systems
2. It can build a very intelligence system tha can help industries to make a very good decisions and predictions
3. It has the capacity for data analysis and visualization of results
