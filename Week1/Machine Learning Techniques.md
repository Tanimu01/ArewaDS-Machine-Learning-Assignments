# In Todays Topic I leaned  how to use some Machine Learning Techniques
-----------------------------------------------------
**Machine Learning Techniques**
Machine Learning Techniques are used to prepare data, Train data, and Build Model using Techniques (like Regression, Classification, Clustering, Anomaly detection, etc.) in order to make a very good decisions and predictions without explict programming or with very less intervention of human. 
**Types of Machine Learning Techniques**
There are three types of Machine Learning Techniques, they are Supervised, Unsupervised and reinforcement learning.

**Supervised Machine Learning Techniques: â€”**
 Is a type of Machine Learning Techniques that uses input and output of known data or labeled data to learn and produce accurate results for future and better decisions.

**Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques: -** 
Its uses techniques/algorithms to find hidden pattern in unlabeled data.

**Reinforcement Machine Learning Techniques:-**
 Is type of Machine Learning Techniques that create model using trial and error until it reaches a better solution.
